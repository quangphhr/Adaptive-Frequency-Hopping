# Adaptive-Frequency-Hopping

## Goal
- To find a smart ways to change the hopping of frequency according to environment

## Task #1
- Measure the message loss when sending the message in the middle channel of 3 wifi ranges and a random hopping way.
- Visually show them if possible

## To do list #1
- Seperate funtion for the sending of message (seed, normal message, acknowlege ...)
- Function for changing frequency using the seed
- Function for generating message: seed, normal, ack, non=confirm message.

## Task #2
- Display Signal strength
- Display Acknowledgment per packet
- Missing channels
- Bar graph showing % of missing per channel
- Documentation: specs of the devices, pictures of the devices, random generation algorithm, how we handshake, which channel we handshake.

## Task #3
- Display channel on receiver end
- Show strong and weak instead of rssi
- Every 64 channels, send 10k messages
- Calc no of weak and strong signals
- Check if you can vary signal strength transmission
- WiFi overlap figure
- Prepare slides and make bargraph
