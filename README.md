# Adaptive-Frequency-Hopping

## Goal
- To find a smart ways to change the hopping of frequency according to environment

## Task #1
- Measure the message loss when sending the message in the middle channel of 3 wifi ranges and a random hopping way.
- Visually show them if possible

## Task #2
- Display Signal strength
- Display Acknowledgment per packet
- Missing channels
- Bar graph showing % of missing per channel
- Documentation: specs of the devices, pictures of the devices, random generation algorithm, how we handshake, which channel we handshake.

## To do list #1
- Seperate funtion for the sending of message (seed, normal message, acknowlege ...)
- Function for changing frequency using the seed
- Function for generating message: seed, normal, ack, non=confirm message.
